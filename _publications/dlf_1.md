abstract: 'We extend the capabilities of the Dynamic Likelihood Filter (DLF), a Bayesian data assimilation filtering approach, tailored to wave problems. The DLF creates richer and more informative likelihoods from observations by evolving their information along characteristics via stochastic differential equations. Through this approach the DLF approach can generate approximate likelihoods in the near future, enabling Bayesian, conditional prediction. A central challenge to the DLF is the transformation of uncertainties between the fixed grid of model dynamics and the observational characteristics. This challenge is addressed in this paper with the application of Gaussian processes.
The resulting multi-analysis DLF approach to filtering bridges the evolution of probability distributions on the fixed grid and along characteristics. The DLF is particularly effective when observations have small inherent measurement errors and are sparse in space and time, a common situation in geophysical and optics wave problems. With a modest increase in computational cost the DLF approach can be adapted to a wide variety of Bayesian filtering methods. We show how the DLF is adapted to the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Numerical comparisons show that the DLF/EnKF outperforms the EnKF estimates, when applied to linear and nonlinear wave problems. This advantage is particularly noticeable when sparse, low uncertainty observations are used.  Improvements are also observed when the DLF/EnKF is compared to advection-dominated flows.'
