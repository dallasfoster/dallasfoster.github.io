Bio
======
My name is Dallas Foster and I am a postdoctoral research assistant with the <a href="https://computing.mit.edu/cesmix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Center for Exascale Simulation of Materials in Extreme Environments</a> and <a href="https://acdl-web.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Aerospace Computational Design Laboratory </a> at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

I am interested in problems at the intersection of Data-driven Inference, Stochastic Dynamics, and Earth Science. My research straddles Data Assimilation, Bayesian and Probabilistic Modeling, Dynamical Systems, and Deep Learning.
