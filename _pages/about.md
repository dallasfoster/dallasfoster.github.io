Bio
======
My name is Dallas Foster and I am a postdoctoral research assistant with the </a> <a href="https://acdl-web.mit.edu/"> Aerospace Computational Design Laboratory </a> at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

I am interested in problems at the intersection of Data-driven Inference, Stochastic Dynamics, and Earth Science. My research has straddled Data Assimilation, Deep Learning, and Bayesian Inference.
